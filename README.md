# Price-Prediction-using-ARIMA-and-LSTM-on-Indian-Stocks
This code fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance, trains an LSTM model on the data to make predictions, uses an ARIMA model to correct the errors in the LSTM predictions, and plots various aspects of the process.
It fetches stock data and transforms it for various plots that go into the ngrok dashboard.

To run this script:

Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.
Set up a .env file with necessary environment variables (like OUTPUT_ADDRESS, LAG, EPOCHS, etc.).
Run the script and enter the stock ticker symbol when prompted.
The script will fetch the stock data, train the models, make predictions, and save the results and plots to the specified output directory.
